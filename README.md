## Project Overview

In this project, I analyze disaster messages provided from Figure Eight https://appen.com/ and build a web app that classifies messages using a ML pipeline into 36 categories.

This classification could potentially help so that a message sent during a disaster could be effectively redirected to the appropriate disaster relief agency. The dataset contains 30,000 messages taken from events including an earthquake in Haiti in 2010, an earthquake in Chile in 2010, floods in Pakistan in 2010, super-storm Sandy in the U.S.A. in 2012, and news articles spanning a large number of years and 100s of different disasters.

Datast is unbalanced dataset. In the web app that is build with this training data one could enter any disaster related message and a classification to related categories will be given to the user as output.
